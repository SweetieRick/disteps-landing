# Disteps Landing Page
Website with simple and responsive design made for the Disteps Project, including basic HTML plus some fancy scss styling

The dependencies used for this project can be found in **package.json** and can be compiled just by the use of *npm*
For the scss compiling, you'll need the **scss compiler**, a compiler which can be found at the (Sass lang website)[https://sass-lang.com/install] 

The compiler used is the **sass compiler**, but the scripting lang is in *.scss* as it is more efficent, tough it's basically the same as it compiles both *.sass* and *.scss* files

To install the util from **npm**, do:
```
npm install sass -g
```

*Enjoy!*
